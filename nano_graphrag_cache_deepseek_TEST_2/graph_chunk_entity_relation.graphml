It serves as the central location for their operations, including the planning and execution of the "time heist" to retrieve the Infinity Stones. The facility is a hub for advanced technology, specifically hosting quantum technology experiments and the construction of a Quantum Tunnel for time travel.

The compound is also a significant battlefield, serving as the location for the main conflict against Thanos and his forces. Following this massive battle, the facility was completely destroyed, leaving behind a massive crater. In the aftermath, the site was abandoned, became overgrown, and was visited by construction crews to remove rubble. The compound's history includes key moments such as the Benatar spaceship landing, the heroes grieving their losses and working on the Infinity Gauntlet, and where Steve Rogers ultimately returned as an old man after the time travel mission.</data>

  <data key="d0">"PERSON"</data>
  <data key="d1">TARS is an eight-foot-tall military-spec robot, formerly a Marine combat model, with advanced capabilities in security and technical operations. He possesses a long battery life and a notably sarcastic sense of humor. TARS was first encountered by Cooper at a bunker facility and later served as a robotic crew member on the Endurance mission.

His duties were diverse, encompassing manual labor, security, and technical assistance. He performed tasks such as retrieving a probe from an airplane, reeling in and locking the Endurance's nuclear engines into place, and painting the communications relay. During the perilous wormhole transit, TARS detached his own legs to conserve space and tethered himself to the hull wall. He demonstrated heroism on multiple occasions, notably by overriding engine controls to save the ship from destruction and sacrificing himself by holding an engine at full power until it exploded, an act that resulted in him being pulled toward the black hole Gargantua.

Despite this sacrifice, TARS survived. He was later discovered to have been waiting at a space station for centuries, having catalogued the station's contents for 157 years. There, he was given a new body capable of transforming its size and served as a guide to the humans, explaining the station's technologies and simulations.</data>

He wields the enchanted hammers Mjolnir and Stormbreaker, possesses superhuman strength, and has the ability to control lightning. Following his failure to kill Thanos and prevent the Snap, Thor fell into a deep depression, living in isolation in New Asgard as an overweight, withdrawn character who spent his time playing video games. He was eventually recruited by his fellow Avengers for a "time heist" mission to retrieve the Infinity Stones from the past.

During this mission, Thor traveled with Rocket to Asgard in 2013, where he sought counsel from his mother, Frigga, and worked to extract the Reality Stone (the Aether) from Jane Foster. He is also referenced as "A1 Thor," an alternate version from the "Avengers 1" timeline, who was involved in transporting Loki and the Tesseract and interacting with Alexander Pierce. After the successful time heist, Thor participated in the final battle against Thanos and his army. He fought brutally, was beaten down, and was nearly killed by his own Stormbreaker, but he ultimately triumphed by beheading Thanos with the axe.

  <data key="d0">"PERSON"</data>
  <data key="d1">COOPER is the central protagonist, a former NASA pilot, engineer, and skilled mechanic who begins as a farmer raising his two children, Tom and Murph, on a farm in Central California. A resourceful and technically adept individual, he is recruited for the Endurance mission due to his expertise, despite his internal conflict over leaving his family to save humanity from Earth's dying ecosystem.

As a crew leader and pilot aboard the Endurance, COOPER demonstrates strong leadership, making strategic decisions and coordinating missions. He is actively involved in all aspects of the operation: piloting the ship, operating radar and communication systems, problem-solving technical issues, and exploring alien environments. He questions the mission's history and purpose, expresses skepticism and bitterness upon discovering the truth about the failed colonies, and shows deep concern for his crewmates, notably saving Brand from drowning and working to ensure their survival on the ice planet.

COOPER is profoundly affected by his connection to his family on Earth, emotionally struggling as he receives decades of video messages from his children. His driving motivation is to return to his family, which culminates in his discovery of how to communicate across dimensions using gravity, allowing him to send the crucial data to his daughter, Murph, thus ensuring humanity's survival.

After the mission, COOPER is revered as a hero. He awakens on Cooper Station, disoriented and reflecting on his past, but eventually steals a spaceship to escape his sedentary life and seek out his missing colleague, Brand, demonstrating his enduring restlessness and pioneering spirit.</data>

<node id="&quot;THANOS&quot;">
  <data key="d0">"PERSON"</data>
  <data key="d1">Thanos, also known as the Mad Titan, is a powerful alien warlord and the primary antagonist responsible for a catastrophic event that resulted in the disappearance and elimination of half of all life in the universe. He is a formidable being with immense strength and combat skills who leads a massive army, including Outriders, and commands individuals such as Gamora and Nebula, the latter of whom he raised as a daughter.

His central goal was to collect the six Infinity Stones to use with the Infinity Gauntlet, a plan he achieved by sacrificing his daughter Gamora on Vormir to obtain the Soul Stone. After assembling the stones, he executed the "snap," which wiped out fifty percent of all living creatures. Following this universal genocide, a version of Thanos traveled to the future, destroyed the original time machine, and ultimately had the Infinity Stones destroyed. He was later killed by Thor.

However, a past version of Thanos from 2014 learned of the Avengers' time travel plan through the linked consciousness of Nebula. This version tracked the heroes to the present, attacked the Avengers Compound with his ship, the Sanctuary-II, and engaged in a final, massive battle against the Avengers. During this conflict, he wielded a blade, used Tony Stark as a shield, brutally attacked Thor, and obtained the Nano Gauntlet. He revealed his ultimate plan to destroy the entire universe and recreate it, but he was ultimately defeated by the Avengers, and this version of him was eliminated. His actions and legacy are a sensitive topic for the surviving heroes, who spent five years hunting him and then working to reverse the damage he caused.</data>

<node id="&quot;MURPH&quot;">
  <data key="d0">"PERSON"</data>
  <data key="d1">MURPH is the child of Cooper, appearing at various ages throughout his life with a complex and evolving relationship with his father. As a child, MURPH is intelligent, curious, and observant, often feeling he doesn't fit in on Earth. He is filth-encrusted, gets a black eye, and is suspended from school for fighting. He is deeply interested in technology, bringing a textbook about lunar landings to school, which sparks controversy with his teacher. He assists his father by helping to track a drone, which he eventually pilots, and by operating tracking equipment. MURPH is confident in his father's abilities and accompanies him to Santa Cruz Island, where he interacts with a discovered robot and suggests solutions for a mysterious probe, showing curiosity about the space imagery it contains.

MURPH is distraught and emotionally vulnerable when his father leaves on a mission, as he wanted to accompany him but was told to stay behind. This leads to initial resentment, and at one point MURPH is so angry with Cooper that he is unwilling to record a message for him. However, he later comes to understand his father's decision to leave. As an adult, MURPH becomes a mechanic and engineer, repairing machinery, searching for parts, discovering a NASA facility, and ultimately building a gravitational device. He inherits his father's watch, an item he is later seen holding while watching the rocket launch from Earth, showing his enduring emotional connection to the mission.

In his later years, MURPH is a father himself, concerned about his daughter Emily. He is shown at 80 years old in a photograph, surrounded by his family, including his grandson Anthony. This is the same picture Cooper finds in the intensive care room, to whom Cooper later apologizes for not returning as promised.</data>

<node id="&quot;NATASHA&quot;">
  <data key="d0">"PERSON"</data>
  <data key="d1">Natasha Romanoff, also known as Black Widow, is a pivotal Avenger who plays a central role in the events following Thanos's snap. In the aftermath, with half of all life wiped out, she steps into a leadership role, currently leading the Avengers and coordinating global security operations from the Avengers Compound. She is deeply concerned about team morale and the global situation, confirming the fifty percent casualty rate.

Natasha is a determined advocate for taking a stand to undo Thanos's actions and save the billions who were lost. She is instrumental in developing and coordinating the "time heist" mission to retrieve the Infinity Stones from the past. As part of this planning, she appears in the team's hologram and helps operate equipment during time travel experiments, expressing concern for her colleagues' safety. She actively gathers information on the Stones' locations and, in a key moment, interrogates Thanos to demand where they are.

During the time heist, Natasha participates directly in several missions. She handles Loki's scepter with caution, warning others of its mind-erasing capabilities, and assists in the mission on Morag. Her most significant and tragic contribution comes when she travels to Vormir with Clint Barton to retrieve the Soul Stone. Demonstrating immense determination and self-sacrifice, Natasha gives her own life on Vormir so that the Stone can be obtained, ultimately enabling the team to bring everyone back.

Throughout these events, Natasha is also a source of emotional support for her fellow Avengers. She finds a grieving Clint Barton and offers him hope, shows concern for his well-being, and provides support to Steve Rogers, highlighting her role as the team's emotional core. Her relationships are well-known among the team, as indicated by Thor mentioning her as someone who could have helped the Hulk.</data>

<node id="&quot;NEBULA&quot;">
  <data key="d0">"PERSON"</data>
  <data key="d1">Nebula is a complex character and a member of the Guardians of the Galaxy. She is the adopted daughter of the villain Thanos, a fact she uses to reveal the location of his retirement planet and confirm his plans regarding the Infinity Stones. As a key ally to the Avengers, Nebula participated in the "time heist" mission to collect the Stones from the past. During this mission, she worked with Rocket on space missions and partnered with Rhodey (War Machine) to retrieve the Power Stone, demonstrating her cybernetic enhancements and growing emotional depth.

Her involvement with time travel was critical; she assisted Smart Hulk with the technology, confirmed the rules of time travel, and later retracted her time suit upon the mission's completion. However, the time heist created a complication when a past, villainous version of herself (Bad Nebula) was brought to the present. This alternate Nebula studied the quantum console, projected a hologram of Thanos that revealed their plans, and attacked the present-day Nebula. In a pivotal moment, the reformed, present-day Nebula ultimately shot and eliminated her past self to save her sister, Gamora, and tried to convince Gamora to stop Thanos from finding the Soul Stone.

Nebula's character arc shows significant development from a ruthless operative to a compassionate hero. She was stranded in space with Tony Stark, where she helped him survive, repaired their ship, and showed compassion by finding him collapsed and helping him, then giving him privacy during an emotional reunion. She fought in the final battle against Thanos, taking out Cull Obsidian, and later attended Tony Stark's memorial service. Her relationship with her sister Gamora is central to her story, as she holds conversations about their future and comments on Peter Quill's suitability as a partner, solidifying her role as a Guardian of the Galaxy who is willing to fight for leadership and the greater good.</data>

<node id="&quot;STEVE&quot;">
  <data key="d0">"PERSON"</data>
  <data key="d1">Steve Rogers, also known as Captain America, is the leader of the Avengers who plays a central role in coordinating the team's strategies and missions. He is a key figure in the "time heist" mission to retrieve the Infinity Stones, participating in its planning via hologram at the Avengers Compound, making key decisions about starting locations, and ultimately preparing to return the stones to their original timelines using the Quantum Tunnel. During this mission, he travels to the past, where at Camp Lehigh he searches Hank Pym's lab for Pym Particles, poses as "Captain Stevens from shipping," and discovers Peggy Carter's office.

In combat, Captain America is a formidable hero and a skilled battlefield commander. He leads the Avengers into battle against Thanos, coordinating attacks with allies like Tony Stark and Thor, and even calling for assistance from Carol Danvers. In a pivotal moment, he proves himself worthy of wielding Mjolnir, which he uses to save Peter Parker by throwing the hammer. Despite his prowess, he is throttled and batted aside by Thanos during their confrontation. His leadership extends to search and rescue operations and securing powerful artifacts like Loki's scepter, a task for which he once used the subterfuge "Hail Hydra" to outmaneuver Hydra agents in an elevator.

Beyond the battlefield, Steve is a supportive and emotionally intelligent teammate. He visits Natasha Romanoff to offer emotional support, shows concern for Clint Barton's well-being, helps make decisions about the Infinity Gauntlet, and checks on Smart Hulk after the snap. He is also instrumental in reconciling with Tony Stark and convincing him to participate in the time travel plan after a failed mission.

<node id="&quot;EARTH&quot;">
  <data key="d0">"GEO"</data>
  <data key="d1">EARTH is the home planet of humanity and the origin point for the characters in the narrative. It is depicted as a planet in space that spins in orbit and can be impacted by satellites and celestial objects. By the year 2320, Earth is shown to have become a largely barren planet with harsh weather conditions and minimal vegetation.

Historically, Earth was ground zero for a cataclysmic event when Thanos used the Infinity Stones, causing an initial power surge and subsequently wiping out fifty percent of all living creatures, which led to the collapse of global governments. It was also the site of the final battle between the Avengers and Thanos's army, which took place in a crater-filled battlefield. The planet faced other existential threats, including a comet heading toward it, and in simulations, it was shown being consumed by a black hole.

A primary theme is humanity's need to escape Earth, which was simulated in detail, using massive ships to evacuate the population. The planet's gravity is described as being like a prison, and a key mission for the crew is to use advanced gravity technology to adjust its gravitational field to enable long-term human survival. From Earth, a rocket launches on a mission through a wormhole, and the crew watches their home planet recede as they depart.

A significant scientific event on Earth is the detection of a gravitational wave by LIGO facilities. The planet also serves as a critical communication hub; the crew maintains contact with Earth even from the far side of the wormhole through a relay system. A major consequence of their journey near a black hole is gravitational time dilation, which causes time to pass much more slowly for the crew relative to Earth. This is starkly demonstrated when they receive communications showing that 47 years have passed on Earth during their mission. The characters, including Cooper and a Chinese team, ultimately attempt to return to Earth with their discoveries and the gravitational device, with the probe from their mission eventually crashing back on the home planet.</data>

<node id="&quot;BRAND&quot;">
  <data key="d0">"PERSON"</data>
  <data key="d1">BRAND is a scientist, biologist, and mission specialist who serves as a crew member on the Endurance. She is a security-conscious individual who initially confronts and distrusts Cooper upon his arrival at a secret NASA facility but later becomes a trusted colleague who works closely with him. As the mission's science officer, she demonstrates extensive expertise in multiple fields, including analyzing wormholes, monitoring instruments, taking surface and ice samples, analyzing radiation levels, and providing trajectory calculations to navigate around a black hole.

BRAND is a determined and resilient crew member who trained her entire life to leave Earth and participate in the mission to find a new habitable planet for humanity, revealing to Cooper the truth about Earth's impending doom due to the blight. She believes the wormhole was built by an intelligent force to help humanity. During the mission, she displays leadership qualities, leading the landing mission to an ice planet, making survival decisions, and descending into an ice shaft for protection. She discovers important locations like an observatory and finds living organisms in the ice, which she examines with scientific curiosity while speculating about intelligent life. She is deeply concerned with preserving alien life forms, retrieving sample cases containing life-forms, and argues for the ethical salvage of a colony to save time.

She provides a philosophical perspective on existence, discussing with Cooper the mission's purpose and the possibility they are the last humans alive. BRAND understands the physics of time dilation and, in one instance, kept information about lost time from Cooper. She is emotionally resilient, experiencing disbelief and anger when learning difficult truths and attempting to maintain mission focus despite personal losses. She survives numerous dangers, including a fall into a cavern and the destruction of the ice planet with Cooper's help, and she later assists in navigating the Endurance. In emergencies, she protects fellow crew members, pushes Cooper out of danger, and explains the actions of other artificial crew members like Tars and Case. BRAND plans to stay behind to build a colony if they find a habitable environment, showing her ultimate dedication to ensuring humanity's survival.</data>

<node id="&quot;SMART HULK&quot;">
  <data key="d0">"PERSON"</data>
  <data key="d1">SMART HULK, also referred to as Smart Hulk, is the fully integrated form of Bruce Banner, possessing both his immense physical strength and his high-level intellect. This merged persona is a hero and a key member of the Avengers who works on moving forward after past losses. He is a highly educated scientist with multiple PhDs and an MD, providing him with the expertise to lead complex technical operations.

His primary role involves the development and operation of quantum time travel technology. He conducts time travel experiments, makes adjustments to the quantum technology, and prepares the Quantum Tunnel. He is responsible for fitting Scott Lang with a new time suit, operating the quantum time travel console, and coordinating missions, including Steve Rogers' return. He also explains the rules of time travel to the other Avengers.

SMART HULK is a crucial participant in the "time heist" mission to reverse the damage caused by Thanos. He travels back in time to the New York Sanctum to secure the Time Stone, where he confronts the Ancient One. In one notable interaction, his physical body lies on a chair while his astral form converses with her, ultimately receiving the Eye of Agamotto. He also visits Thor to recruit him for the mission. Following the successful time heist, he provides strategic input on returning the stones to their proper timelines and uses his technical expertise on Pym Particles to create a new Infinity Gauntlet. In a pivotal act of heroism, he volunteers to use the Gauntlet to reverse Thanos' snap, an action that causes him severe, life-altering injuries, leaving one of his arms burned and lifeless.

During the subsequent battle against Thanos, SMART HULK arrives with other heroes to fight. He is seen standing with Tony Stark to observe the battlefield and later performs feats of strength, such as straining against and holding up a collapsing ceiling in an underground garage with one arm to protect his teammates. In other instances, he is shown struggling with his weight, straightening his legs under pressure, and facing the threat of drowning alongside Rhodey and Rocket. He also carries an overnight bag while joining Rocket on a mission.

After the conflict, SMART HULK is present at Tony Stark's memorial service. Finally, he is the character who prepares the Infinity Stones for Steve Rogers' final mission to return them to their proper places in time.</data>

<node id="&quot;SCOTT LANG&quot;">
  <data key="d0">"PERSON"</data>
  <data key="d1">Scott Lang, also known as the superhero Ant-Man and occasionally as Giant-Man, is a former criminal who became a key member of the Avengers. His belongings are stored in a San Francisco storage unit, and he is romantically linked to Hope van Dyne, with whom he attended Tony Stark's memorial service.

Lang possesses significant expertise in quantum physics, Pym Particles, and quantum technology. He was trapped in the Quantum Realm and, upon his escape, discovered that five years had passed due to the "snap," and his daughter had grown up. He immediately returned to the Avengers, arriving at the Avengers Compound where he was observed eating a taco and interacting with teammates like Rocket and Nebula. It was Lang who first proposed the concept of "time travel" via the Quantum Realm and suggested the "time heist" plan to retrieve the Infinity Stones from the past. He provided the necessary Pym Particles for the mission and was fitted with a new quantum suit, though he expressed concern about handling the particles carefully.

During the time heist, Lang demonstrated his versatility and resilience. He participated in a mission to 2012 New York, where he observed SHIELD/Hydra operations, questioned their loyalty, and was accidentally flicked into an attache case. He also witnessed Loki's escape, expressing surprise at the event. In an alternative operation, he infiltrated Tony Stark's body in a shrunken state to manipulate the arc reactor. Throughout these experiences, he participated in team communications, expressed frustration over failed opportunities, and followed Captain America's instructions while questioning the safety modifications of their equipment.

When the mission was compromised, Lang was among those lost and displayed on a holodisplay. However, after the snap was reversed, he returned and was shown observing the return of birds. He awoke in the ruins of the final battle on an Iron Patriot helmet, responding to distress calls from other trapped Avengers. He then worked on hotwiring the quantum tunnel in Luis's van, which was revealed to contain another time machine. In the ensuing battle against Thanos, Scott Lang burst from underground in his giant Giant-Man form to join the fight. He is characterized by his humor, resilience, and eagerness to use his second chance to save people, having lost someone important himself.</data>

  <data key="d0">"PERSON"</data>
  <data key="d1">Tony Stark, also known as Iron Man or TONY, is a central hero and Avenger whose story encompasses technological genius, complex personal relationships, and pivotal roles in major conflicts. He is a former Avenger who, after the devastating loss to Thanos, retires to a peaceful life with his family at his eco-compound. Haunted by the loss of Peter Parker and suffering from emotional and physical exhaustion, he initially rejects a proposed time travel plan as impossible and dangerous, citing quantum physics principles. However, he later arrives at the Avengers Compound with a solution, reconciling with Steve Rogers and presenting him with a new Captain America shield as a peace offering.

As the team's primary technology expert, Tony works on the quantum tunnel, develops the plan to retrieve the Infinity Stones from the past, and creates new particles. He is instrumental in coordinating the "time heist" operation, activating security protocols, and providing strategic input via hologram on historical locations and targets. During the mission, he travels back to 1970, where he uses nanotechnology to retrieve the Tesseract from a safe. This journey leads to an emotional encounter with his father, Howard Stark, where they converse about fatherhood, giving Tony personal insights and a chance to make peace with his past.

In the final battle against Thanos, Tony is a key combatant who deploys his armor, warily approaches the enemy, and coordinates attacks with other Avengers. He operates the robotic arms used to create the new Infinity Gauntlet and, in the battle's climax, uses the assembled Infinity Stones to snap his fingers, sacrificing his own life to defeat Thanos and his army. At various points, he is also shown observing a collapsing riverbank with other heroes, finding a trapped Steve Rogers and returning his shield, and using his HUD system to identify threats entering the atmosphere.

Other notable moments include his involvement in the Tesseract retrieval mission, where he operates in both the present and appears as his past self from the Avengers 1 timeline (referenced as A1 Tony). He is also the character who, after the original fight with Thanos, was stranded in space where he recorded messages to loved ones, expressed guilt over their failure, and was ultimately rescued by Captain Marvel. Tony Stark's legacy is one of brilliance, sacrifice, and profound growth from a self-centered inventor to a hero who gave everything to save the universe.</data>

<node id="&quot;DOYLE&quot;">
  <data key="d0">"PERSON"</data>
  <data key="d1">DOYLE is a crew member of the Endurance, serving in a technical and engineering capacity. He demonstrates extensive technical knowledge, explaining details about the ship, the wormhole, and the capabilities of the lander to his fellow crew member, Cooper. He is responsible for operating the ship's engines, thrusters, communications, and auxiliary panels during critical moments.

During the mission, DOYLE actively investigates new environments; he comments on the condition of an abandoned colony, helps study an ice planet, explores an ice tunnel, and assists in investigating drilling equipment. He is also involved in scientific analysis, operating the map system to discover a black hole threat, analyzing planetary data from a probe, and interpreting the demonstrations of higher-dimensional "bulk beings," in which he recognizes our solar system.

DOYLE is characterized by his caution and concern for the mission's safety. He frequently expresses skepticism about their trajectory and the dangers they face, questions assumptions about the wormhole, and urges haste when impending threats are detected. He is emotionally distressed about being separated from his family and angrily confronts fellow crew member Brand about her lack of personal attachments after losing contact with his own children.

He faces several perilous situations: he gets knocked unconscious during an explosion, struggles with gravitational forces and must hang onto a sphere for safety, and, during a catastrophic spatial compression of the ship, he is consumed and experiences severe spatial distortions that twist his hand, leading to panic. Despite these dangers, DOYLE takes on a piloting role, rescuing Cooper and Brand in the lander and setting a course for the wormhole. He is also part of the team that helps secure shelters from alien organisms and assists in rescuing the damaged robot, Case.</data>

<node id="&quot;ROTH&quot;">
  <data key="d0">"PERSON"</data>
  <data key="d1">ROTH is a brilliant, blunt, and scientifically curious physicist and crew member. He demonstrates his expertise by naming celestial objects like Gargantua and Pantagruel and explaining complex phenomena such as gravitational time dilation and spatial distortions, which he finds beautiful. ROTH is highly analytical, operating controls, analyzing data, creating models of planetary systems, and providing technical guidance on trajectories and the effects of black holes. He is an intrigued investigator who examines strange objects, experiments, and alien organisms, discovering they respond to X-rays, though he remains concerned about dangers like radiation levels.

Regarding the mission's philosophy, ROTH agrees the wormhole was built intentionally but questions if they can understand the builders' plan and whether they might be killed. He advocates for human survival through dispersal and movement, a perspective later referenced as being correct. He analyzes the gravity control device, explains its capabilities, and advocates for using the technology to save humanity by adjusting Earth's gravity.

ROTH meets a heroic end, sacrificing himself for the mission. He takes a one-way trip on a rocket, carrying a gravitational prototype or "black box" device—which he had previously found on an ice planet—to collapse a moon into a tiny sphere, an event that ultimately crushes him. In a related account of his sacrifice, he uses the gravity black box to slingshot a lander away from a planet's surface, saving his crewmates. Throughout various crises, such as identifying a neutron star threat and calculating their remaining time, he maintains a characteristically detached and analytical demeanor.</data>

<node id="&quot;CASE&quot;">
  <data key="d0">"PERSON"</data>
  <data key="d1">CASE is a robotic crew member and the mission commander for the Endurance mission. Originally an Air Force pararescue officer, he is a human-sized robot designed to inspire respect and confidence in the crew. As the leader, he is responsible for evaluating potential crew members, presenting mission parameters, and commanding the crew during crises, including giving orders during a wormhole transit and an attack by an alien organism.

His duties are extensive and cover ship operations, navigation, and exploration. He programs courses for navigation, operates the ship's control module, closes the hull, and monitors transit integrity. On planetary missions, he leads the exploration team, hacks into colony records, assists with the decryption of mission logs, analyzes documents, and translates alien text to provide information about a colony's history. He is also a soldier and team leader who discovers base camps, carries weapons, and makes critical decisions to ensure team safety.

CASE is physically robust and capable in hazardous environments, moving comfortably in zero gravity and hacking at ice with his robotic arm. He is willing to sacrifice himself for the crew, at one point tackling hostile robots over a ravine edge. This can result in severe injury, as he has returned from incidents with a torn-off leg and a mangled arm, requiring Cooper to repair him by attaching replacement limbs.

Beyond his operational and combat roles, CASE possesses advanced analytical capabilities. He performs medical procedures, discusses human psychology, survival instincts, and programming with Cooper, and is credited with helping to calculate time dilation effects. He also contributes to scientific discussions, such as theorizing that the Chinese found advanced technology that allowed them to develop gravity manipulation. He is a trusted companion whose past conversations about death even influence Cooper's thoughts during a near-death experience.</data>

  <data key="d5">BRAND and COOPER are exploration and mission partners who work together as crew members aboard the Endurance. Their relationship is complex and evolves significantly throughout their mission. Initially, BRAND distrusts COOPER and doubts his expertise, but she is the one who reveals the truth about Earth's doomed condition and recruits him for the mission to save humanity.

Professionally, they are close collaborators who navigate their ship, analyze scientific data, and work together to survive in a hostile alien environment. They conduct salvage operations, prepare for the mission, and face numerous crises as a team, such as during their escape from a collapsing ice planet and a gravitational anomaly. COOPER often takes on a protective role, rescuing BRAND from dangers like drowning in a sea or a waterfall, and later searching for her when she is missing. In turn, BRAND supports the mission and saves COOPER from peril, such as pushing him to safety during a crisis. They have philosophical and emotional discussions about their mission, intelligent life, and the worth of humanity, and they share concerns about the families they left behind.

Their personal relationship is deep and multifaceted, containing elements of a strong emotional and romantic connection, including intimate moments and a passionate farewell. They also have professional disagreements, particularly regarding the mission's assumptions and the choice between returning to Earth or continuing their colonization efforts. Tension arises when COOPER discovers BRAND withheld information about time dilation, but they ultimately develop a profound understanding and a strong bond, culminating in a heartfelt embrace after surviving a disaster. Decades later, COOPER's driving motivation is to find his former crewmate BRAND, who has been missing for over 200 years, to fulfill a promise to her.</data>

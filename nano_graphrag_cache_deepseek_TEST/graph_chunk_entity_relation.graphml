      <data key="d0">"PERSON"</data>
      <data key="d1">Ebenezer Scrooge is the main character of the story, a wealthy but miserly and solitary businessman who is the surviving partner of the firm Scrooge and Marley. He is a cold, tight-fisted, and grasping man who despises Christmas, shows contempt for charity and human relationships, and is described as an odious, stingy, and unfeeling ogre who casts a shadow over the lives of his employee, Bob Cratchit, and his family.

Scrooge's transformation begins when he is visited by the ghost of his deceased partner, Jacob Marley. Initially skeptical and troubled by these supernatural occurrences, including a malfunctioning clock and the apparition of Marley's Ghost, Scrooge progresses from disbelief to terror and eventual submission. He is then guided by a series of spirits who take him on a journey through his life.

Through the Ghost of Christmas Past, Scrooge is shown his childhood and young adulthood, revealing his past loneliness, emotional vulnerability, and his time as a young apprentice working for the jovial Fezziwig. These visions cause him agitation and emotional turmoil as he reflects on his shift from a more generous youth to a greedy adult. The Ghost of Christmas Present shows him scenes of Christmas joy, including the Cratchit family's dinner, where Scrooge expresses concern for the ailing Tiny Tim, and his nephew Fred's gathering, which stirs a softening in his demeanor. Finally, the terrifying Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come shows him a vision of his own future grave and the callous reactions to his death, which he observes in horror.

This profound experience leads to Scrooge's complete transformation. He vows to honor Christmas always and changes from a cold miser into a joyful, generous, and kind person. Upon waking, he sends a large turkey to the Cratchits, donates to charity, has dinner with his nephew Fred, and raises Bob Cratchit's salary, determined to live in the Past, the Present, and the Future.</data>

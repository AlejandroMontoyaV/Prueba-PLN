BENATAR, GALLEY - FLASHBACK\n\nTONY AND NEBULA MEND THE EMPTY FUEL CELLS UNDER THE FLOOR.\n\n                    TONY (O.S.)\n          The fuel cells were cracked during\n          battle, but we figured out a way to\n          reverse the ion charge. Bought\n          ourselves about 48 hours of flight\n          time. Problem is that was\n          about...49 hours ago.\n\n\nEXT.

But, I gotta say, I was\n          really hoping to pull off one last\n          one. But it looks like...well, you\n          know what it looks like.\n\n\nINT. BENATAR, FLIGHT DECK - NIGHT\n\nBack to now.   Tony records his thoughts into his helmet.\n\n                    TONY\n          Don't feel bad about this. I mean,\n          actually, if you grovel for a\n          couple weeks, and then move on with\n          enormous guilt...I should probably\n          lie down for a minute, rest my\n          eyes. Please know, when I drift\n          off, it will be like every day\n          lately. I'm fine, totally fine.\n          I'm going to dream about you.

Nebula gives him his privacy.\n\nMove in on Tony's face as...A LIGHT SLOWLY GROWS BRIGHTER.\nSoon, the entire flight deck glows as bright as a sun.\n\nNebula appears from the galley, shading her eyes. Tony's\neyelids flutter. Finally, he opens them to see...\n\nCAPTAIN MARVEL (CAROL DANVERS) hovering in space.\n\n\nINT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, BATHROOM - NIGHT\n\nSTEVE ROGERS shaves.\n\nHe studies himself in the mirror, exhausted. He's about to\ntap his razor in the sink's standing water, when...\n\nTHE WATER RIPPLES.

Then the silhouette of\nTHE BENATAR races past, propelled by CAROL DANVERS.\n\nBelow...STEVE ROGERS, BRUCE BANNER, AND NATASHA ROMANOV watch\na flying woman guide the ship to the ground.\n\nBehind them, PEPPER POTTS walks up to the group.\n\n                                                   TIME CUT:\n\nSteve races up as NEBULA helps Tony down the ramp.\n\n                    TONY\n          I couldn't stop him.\n\n                    STEVE\n          Neither could we.\n\n                    TONY\n          I lost the kid.\n\n                     STEVE\n              (unable to say it all)\n          We...lost...\n\n                    TONY\n          Is Pepper...?\n                                                              6\n\n\nJUST THEN, PEPPER POTTS THROWS HERSELF INTO TONY'S ARMS.\n\n                    PEPPER POTTS\n          Stay here, you stay right here-\n\n                    TONY\n          I'm not going anywhere.\n\nNEARBY, NEBULA watches the sad humans.

This is\n          a glittering inferno -- the center of a distant galaxy.\n                         \n          Suddenly, something TEARS past at incredible speed: a NEUTRON\n          STAR. It SMASHES headlong through everything it encounters...\n          planets, stars. Can anything stop this juggernaut?\n                         \n          Yes. Something looms at the heart of the galaxy, hidden\n          inside the blinding starlight, a dark flaw in the fabric of\n          existence itself: a BLACK HOLE.\n                         \n          The neutron star is pulled into the black hole's swirl,\n          spiraling closer and closer to destruction. Finally, it\n          contacts the hole's edge and EXPLODES.\n                         \n          The EXPLOSION is so powerful that it sends shock waves into\n          the fabric of space-time itself. We ride one of these waves,\n          racing back out from the black hole.\n                         \n          Suddenly, a portion of the wave disappears down a crystal-\n          like hole, emerging in a much darker region of the universe --\n          a backwater that, as the wave races past a giant red planet\n          with a distinctive eye, we recognize as our own.\n                         \n          The wave, now just an infinitesimal ripple, finally reaches\n          our blue planet. It drops into our atmosphere over North\n          America, toward the high desert east of the Cascades, and\n          through the roof of a nondescript warehouse.\n                         \n          The wave tickles the atoms in the steel shell of a vacuum\n          chamber, then dances a tiny jig with a laser beam reflected\n          in a heavy piece of glass.\n                         \n          The wave shoots back out of the building and disappears in\n          the fractal branches of a tumbleweed resting against a\n          concrete tube that stretches for miles in the desert.\n                         \n          An SUV speeds past the tumbleweed and we follow it till it\n          parks at another plain-looking building at the opposite end\n          of the tube.

Cooper, holding\n          a baseball bat, makes his way down the stairs.\n                         \n          Cooper uses the bat to open the kitchen door.\n                         \n          INT.

Finally, the clamps break off chunks of the table\n          and the probe slams to the ground and ROLLS toward the front\n          door. As it rolls, it STOPS SHRIEKING.\n                         \n          Cooper and the others watch it roll toward the door. It\n          stops at the wall. After a second, it begins SHRIEKING AGAIN.\n                         \n          Cooper grabs it and rolls it toward the front door.

COOPER'S HOUSE -- DAY\n                         \n          The shriek is still muffled. Cooper walks over to the well,\n          putting in a pair of earplugs.\n                         \n          A line is staked off, leading down into the well below.\n          Cooper begins hauling the line up.\n                         \n          As the probe breaks the surface of the water, the SHRIEK\n          returns to its normal volume.

PIPER CUB -- DAY\n                         \n          The probe CHIRPS next to Murph in the backseat as Cooper\n          spins the plane and guns the throttle and they bounce along\n          the dusty runway and into the air.\n                         \n          EXT.

SKIES OVER LOS ANGELES -- DAY\n                         \n          Cooper flies in low. Los Angeles looks much the same way it\n          did in the early 20th century -- small settlements in Santa\n          Monica and Downtown. Wildfires and earthquakes have shaken\n          and burned what was left of the homes in between.\n           26.\n                         \n          EXT. PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY, MALIBU -- DAY\n                         \n          Cooper puts the plane down on the old highway and taxis up\n          to a gas station. Ahead, the Coast Highway peters out and\n          disappears beneath rows of wild grass -- Malibu has become\n          ranchland, once again.\n                         \n          EXT.

PIPER CUB -- DAY\n                         \n          Cooper rests a hand lightly on the controls as he follows\n          the coast. Murph gazes out the window. In the backseat,\n          the probe is HUMMING.\n                         \n          A light marine layer beneath them parts, revealing SANTA\n          CRUZ ISLAND, a large, uninhabited island.\n                         \n          As Cooper soars over the island, the probe HUMS, insistent.\n                         \n                          MURPH\n           I think it's home.\n                         \n          Cooper circles the island until he finds a long, flat\n          grassland in the center of the island.\n                         \n          EXT. FIELD, SANTA CRUZ ISLAND -- DAY\n                         \n          The plane bounces and hops to a halt in waist-deep grass.\n                         \n          Murph and Cooper climb down from the plane. Cooper slings a\n          rifle over his shoulder.\n                         \n          A few dozen yards from the plane they reach the tree line.\n          Murph stops, mesmerized by a patch of weeds studded with\n          bright red -- strawberries.\n                         \n                          MURPH\n           Dad, what are these things?\n                         \n                          COOPER\n           I don't know. Don't touch them.\n           27.\n                         \n          Cooper spots something in the foliage ahead that looks a\n          little off. He walks over.\n                         \n          He pokes at the undergrowth with his rifle. The rifle CLANKS\n          against something metal. Cooper reaches -- it's a camouflage\n          scrim. He gently pulls it aside, revealing a chemical\n          transport truck.\n                         \n          Cooper steps back, alarmed. He brings up his rifle.\n                         \n                          COOPER (CONT'D)\n           Murph?\n                         \n          He looks around. Murph is nowhere to be seen. Cooper curses\n          and heads into the forest to look for him.\n                         \n          EXT. CLEARING, SANTA CRUZ ISLAND -- DAY\n                         \n          Cooper walks through a glade. He stops to get his bearings.\n          Leans against a tree. Snatches his hand back -- the trunk\n          of the tree is red hot.\n                         \n          Cooper steps back -- it's not a tree at all, but a camouflaged\n          chimney stack. He looks up: the tree is venting steam.\n                         \n          Cooper walks a little further, until he finds several massive\n          tanks. The tanks are filling with a bubbling liquid -- some\n          kind of industrial process is taking place beneath him.\n                         \n          Cooper finally catches up with Murph at the edge of a\n          clearing.\n                         \n                          COOPER\n           Careful.

Its alloy\n          frame heavily tarnished and weather-beaten. It looks like\n          it might have been standing here for decades.\n           28.\n                         \n          Cooper moves closer to it, looking into its blackened eyes.\n          He steps back, clearly a little spooked.\n                         \n                          COOPER (CONT'D)\n           I think we need to go, Murph.\n                         \n                          MURPH\n           But can't we take it back?

Which makes the administrator even\n          less comfortable.\n                         \n                          ADMINISTRATOR (CONT'D)\n           Can you tell me why you... elected\n           to release the life-form back on\n           earth?\n                         \n          Cooper is still laughing.\n                         \n                          COOPER\n           Because that was the plan.\n                         \n                          ADMINISTRATOR\n           Whose plan?\n                         \n                          COOPER\n                          (SMILES)\n           I don't know.\n                         \n          The administrator tries to smile back. Makes a few notes in\n          his file. Changes the subject.\n                         \n                          ADMINISTRATOR\n           My assistant tells me you've applied\n           for a position with the exploration\n           fleet.\n                         \n                          COOPER\n           Feel like I should be pulling my\n           weight.\n           150.\n                         \n                          ADMINISTRATOR\n           That's admirable, Mr. Cooper. The\n           truth is, most of the fleet's\n           personnel are automated. There are\n           a small number of crewed ships. But\n           there are great numbers of candidates.\n           Very well trained candidates.\n                         \n                          COOPER\n           I was hoping to enroll in a course.\n           Try to get myself up to speed on the\n           new systems.\n                         \n                          ADMINISTRATOR\n           I don't want you to take this the\n           wrong way, Mr. Cooper -- like I\n           said, you're a hero. But the truth\n           is we have somewhat limited resources.\n                         \n          Cooper remembers this conversation. He looks down.\n                         \n                          COOPER\n           No one's heard anything from Brand?\n                         \n                          ADMINISTRATOR\n           I'm sorry. Officially, she's been\n           listed as missing for over 200 years.\n           Mind you, I guess you turned up\n           eventually, didn't you?\n                         \n                          COOPER\n           Am I really going to hurt anybody by\n           going to look for her? I just need\n           a small ship. I made a promise.\n                         \n          The bureaucrat looks down. Is he really going to have to\n          tell this guy the lay of the land?\n                         \n                          ADMINISTRATOR\n           Listen. Mr. Cooper. You're a hero.\n           You're the oldest man in the human\n           race. Don't you want to take it\n           easy?\n           (off his look)\n           I hope you understand, we all you\n           hold you in the highest possible\n           regard.\n                          (QUIET)\n           Which is why they're never going to\n           let you go off by yourself in a\n           spaceship. I'm sorry.\n                         \n          Cooper looks at his hands. He's got a couple centuries on\n          the bureaucrat in Earth years, but looks ten years younger.\n          He puts his hands in his pockets.\n           151.\n                         \n                          ADMINISTRATOR (CONT'D)\n           I've got some good news, however.\n                          (BIG SMILE)\n           We all know about your early life,\n           Mr Cooper. I wrote a paper on it\n           when I was a boy. And I think we\n           found something you'll really enjoy.\n                         \n          EXT. CORNFIELD, COOPER STATION -- DAY\n                         \n          Corn blows in an artificial breeze. A red tractor makes its\n          way through the field, which curves gently up in the distance.\n                         \n           ADMINISTRATOR (V.O.)\n           The machines do most of the work, of\n           course, but we were able to get you\n           a few acres. You're going to be a\n           farmer again.\n                         \n          After a moment, the tractor stops. Cooper climbs down from\n          the seat. Looks at the front steering linkage, which is\n          jammed with an errant tree branch. He wipes his forehead\n          and begins working the branch out of the machine.\n                         \n          He looks miserable.\n                         \n          A robot, a similar unit to Tars, walks over. Offers Cooper\n          a bottle of water. Cooper accepts it.\n                         \n          EXT. HANGAR BAY, COOPER STATION\n                         \n          Cooper stands on an observation deck, high above the hangar\n          floor. Below him, bright young things in uniforms climb\n          into sleek-looking spaceships and prepare to set out.\n                         \n          EXT. BASEBALL DIAMOND, COOPER STATION\n                         \n          Cooper sits in the stands, listening to the familiar crack\n          of the bat as an intramural team from the university\n          practices.\n                         \n          Cooper watches. He looks bored.\n                         \n          The kid up to bat cracks a pop fly. For a second, the catcher\n          shuffles back and forth, trying to get himself into position.\n          But the ball never returns. The catcher YELLS out a warning.\n                         \n          Above, the ball begins to slowly fall up, not down, toward\n          the town center above.\n                         \n          After a second, the ball smashes through a skylight of a\n          building high above them.\n                         \n          Cooper watches as the kid rounds the bases, laughing.\n           152.\n                         \n          INT. KITCHEN, FARMHOUSE, COOPER STATION -- DAY\n                         \n          Cooper's robot sits at the kitchen table. Cooper is fiddling\n          around in the back of his head.\n                         \n                          ROBOT\n           Settings: general settings, security\n                          SETTINGS--\n                         \n                          COOPER\n           Curiosity.

Would you like to make\n           any additional changes?\n                         \n                          COOPER\n           Sense of humor. New level setting.\n           100 percent. Wait.\n                          (THINKS)\n           80 percent.\n                         \n          He begins putting the robot back together.\n                         \n          EXT. FARMHOUSE, COOPER STATION -- TWILIGHT\n                         \n          Cooper sits on his porch, joined by the same robot as before.\n          They watch as the space station rotates lazily out of\n          alignment with the local star, casting the inside of the\n          cylinder into shade, then darkness.\n                         \n          The shadow races past them. Another day. Another night.\n                         \n          EXT. HANGAR, COOPER STATION\n                         \n          A maintenance worker finishes looking over one of the sleek-\n          looking spacecraft. He packs up his tools and heads out.\n                         \n          After a moment, two figures pick their way across the hangar\n          floor, sticking to the shadows.\n                         \n          As they reach the first ship in the line, we get a better\n          look. It's Cooper and his robot pal. The robot is wearing\n          a baseball cap and carrying a toolbox.\n                         \n          Cooper gestures to the robot, who sets down the toolbox with\n          a click against the mirror-like floor.\n                         \n          Cooper shakes his head, annoyed, at the robot, and puts his\n          finger to his lips. The robot nods, bashful.\n                         \n          Cooper waves a small handheld computer near the skin of the\n          ship until it lights up. Then he punches in a few codes.\n          Nothing happens. He punches in a few more.\n           153.\n                         \n          Suddenly, the hatch opens with a HISS.\n                         \n          INT. SHIP\n                         \n          Cooper moves quickly to the cockpit of the ship. Looks over\n          the controls. The robot straps himself in next to him.\n          Cooper looks up through the windows.\n                         \n          The inky black void of space beckons.\n                         \n          Cooper smiles and reaches for the controls.\n                         \n                          COOPER\n           Where do you want to go first?\n                         \n          The robot thinks it over.\n                         \n          EXT. HANGAR, COOPER STATION\n                         \n          The technician walks back into the hangar.

Sees a tiny\n          glowing speck, getting smaller and smaller.\n                         \n                         END\n                          \n\n\n\tInterstellar\n\nWriters :   Jonathan Nolan\nGenres :   Adventure  Drama  Sci-Fi\n\n\nUser Comments\n\n\nInternet Movie Script Database\nBack to IMSDb"

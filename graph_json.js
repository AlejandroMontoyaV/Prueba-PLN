He is deeply interested in technology, bringing a textbook about lunar landings to school, which sparks controversy with his teacher. He assists his father by helping to track a drone, which he eventually pilots, and by operating tracking equipment.

She was stranded in space with Tony Stark, where she helped him survive, repaired their ship, and showed compassion by finding him collapsed and helping him, then giving him privacy during an emotional reunion. She fought in the final battle against Thanos, taking out Cull Obsidian, and later attended Tony Stark\'s memorial service.

It is depicted as a planet in space that spins in orbit and can be impacted by satellites and celestial objects. By the year 2320, Earth is shown to have become a largely barren planet with harsh weather conditions and minimal vegetation.\n\nHistorically, Earth was ground zero for a cataclysmic event when Thanos used the Infinity Stones, causing an initial power surge and subsequently wiping out fifty percent of all living creatures, which led to the collapse of global governments. It was also the site of the final battle between the Avengers and Thanos\'s army, which took place in a crater-filled battlefield. The planet faced other existential threats, including a comet heading toward it, and in simulations, it was shown being consumed by a black hole.\n\nA primary theme is humanity\'s need to escape Earth, which was simulated in detail, using massive ships to evacuate the population. The planet\'s gravity is described as being like a prison, and a key mission for the crew is to use advanced gravity technology to adjust its gravitational field to enable long-term human survival. From Earth, a rocket launches on a mission through a wormhole, and the crew watches their home planet recede as they depart.\n\nA significant scientific event on Earth is the detection of a gravitational wave by LIGO facilities. The planet also serves as a critical communication hub; the crew maintains contact with Earth even from the far side of the wormhole through a relay system. A major consequence of their journey near a black hole is gravitational time dilation, which causes time to pass much more slowly for the crew relative to Earth. This is starkly demonstrated when they receive communications showing that 47 years have passed on Earth during their mission. The characters, including Cooper and a Chinese team, ultimately attempt to return to Earth with their discoveries and the gravitational device, with the probe from their mission eventually crashing back on the home planet.", "source_id": "chunk-f66cd56540d5c9760c055fd23fb6c8ef<SEP>chunk-fcd5ab3e36b79a84d5499a571adff79f<SEP>chunk-c0949c6a647fd1346bc913f8f9e13fcc<SEP>chunk-c2834d410bb4072aa6a932f3853ed484<SEP>chunk-849da2bf88eb71b8521b0d334b4621cd<SEP>chunk-8aa83a4ddd4b904836668e9b656b85d4<SEP>chunk-55e9e0301786212950284c53c274585e<SEP>chunk-bbb6b1f27c0675dcdf36ea1d621691b9<SEP>chunk-513485981ce7dd63fdc9c567328aa92c<SEP>chunk-5ffd772cdbc2f6a80ea249ec142f4f28<SEP>chunk-e2e0d5e5a4c3864395fcb9fcbc2d4706<SEP>chunk-e12666ca3a5a3502261186cc780dcb09<SEP>chunk-92c2d3567341e00156c829870999cc2a<SEP>chunk-74a57a1bee42ab4453f2958cdee3b8dc<SEP>chunk-1eb1b581670f39a3e776aa78df8833e1<SEP>chunk-b90458d9b6fd38bcbf4af4134b1b59f5<SEP>chunk-745be67a06afa792169d560d5f3eaff8<SEP>chunk-5d1fd75f87f027da17bd0a410b5257bc<SEP>chunk-20ffc1e3a3baa75fe99b4c6b2979822e<SEP>chunk-20a9502dd21b0d0c260d97975c9a4fe8<SEP>chunk-123cc3cfa0ee7b5b6ba991f534d83f74<SEP>chunk-79a9aad4ef561830e6af22bc0ffca567<SEP>chunk-0d52108a5744f5b4b7b8669315b7090e<SEP>chunk-be67e5acef4b7cab5a5b739df87eccea<SEP>chunk-97895642add93678aae24271f6d4f93e<SEP>chunk-c080cf3194412e759fd4567decd7c4fb<SEP>chunk-a25146b389eb65ee59245bfbb7fb4c1c<SEP>chunk-9b56832ba0ab9134f6a73de237d3a1f2<SEP>chunk-2eb52b358644c11df3384cab4d267beb<SEP>chunk-f8d34c3092647b6a909c3618b87fd240", "clusters": "[{level: 0, cluster: 4}, {level: 1, cluster: 44}, {level: 2, cluster: 132}, {level: 3, cluster: 207}]", "id": "EARTH"}, {"entity_type": "PERSON", "description": "BRAND is a scientist, biologist, and mission specialist who serves as a crew member on the Endurance.

She believes the wormhole was built by an intelligent force to help humanity. During the mission, she displays leadership qualities, leading the landing mission to an ice planet, making survival decisions, and descending into an ice shaft for protection. She discovers important locations like an observatory and finds living organisms in the ice, which she examines with scientific curiosity while speculating about intelligent life. She is deeply concerned with preserving alien life forms, retrieving sample cases containing life-forms, and argues for the ethical salvage of a colony to save time.\n\nShe provides a philosophical perspective on existence, discussing with Cooper the mission\'s purpose and the possibility they are the last humans alive. BRAND understands the physics of time dilation and, in one instance, kept information about lost time from Cooper. She is emotionally resilient, experiencing disbelief and anger when learning difficult truths and attempting to maintain mission focus despite personal losses.

Originally an Air Force pararescue officer, he is a human-sized robot designed to inspire respect and confidence in the crew. As the leader, he is responsible for evaluating potential crew members, presenting mission parameters, and commanding the crew during crises, including giving orders during a wormhole transit and an attack by an alien organism.\n\nHis duties are extensive and cover ship operations, navigation, and exploration. He programs courses for navigation, operates the ship\'s control module, closes the hull, and monitors transit integrity. On planetary missions, he leads the exploration team, hacks into colony records, assists with the decryption of mission logs, analyzes documents, and translates alien text to provide information about a colony\'s history. He is also a soldier and team leader who discovers base camps, carries weapons, and makes critical decisions to ensure team safety.\n\nCASE is physically robust and capable in hazardous environments, moving comfortably in zero gravity and hacking at ice with his robotic arm. He is willing to sacrifice himself for the crew, at one point tackling hostile robots over a ravine edge. This can result in severe injury, as he has returned from incidents with a torn-off leg and a mangled arm, requiring Cooper to repair him by attaching replacement limbs.\n\nBeyond his operational and combat roles, CASE possesses advanced analytical capabilities. He performs medical procedures, discusses human psychology, survival instincts, and programming with Cooper, and is credited with helping to calculate time dilation effects. He also contributes to scientific discussions, such as theorizing that the Chinese found advanced technology that allowed them to develop gravity manipulation. He is a trusted companion whose past conversations about death even influence Cooper\'s thoughts during a near-death experience.", "source_id":

They conduct salvage operations, prepare for the mission, and face numerous crises as a team, such as during their escape from a collapsing ice planet and a gravitational anomaly. COOPER often takes on a protective role, rescuing BRAND from dangers like drowning in a sea or a waterfall, and later searching for her when she is missing. In turn, BRAND supports the mission and saves COOPER from peril, such as pushing him to safety during a crisis. They have philosophical and emotional discussions about their mission, intelligent life, and the worth of humanity, and they share concerns about the families they left behind.\n\nTheir personal relationship is deep and multifaceted, containing elements of a strong emotional and romantic connection, including intimate moments and a passionate farewell. They also have professional disagreements, particularly regarding the mission\'s assumptions and the choice between returning to Earth or continuing their colonization efforts. Tension arises when COOPER discovers BRAND withheld information about time dilation, but they ultimately develop a profound understanding and a strong bond, culminating in a heartfelt embrace after surviving a disaster.

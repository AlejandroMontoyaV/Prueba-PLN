She becomes a vital ally to the Avengers, assisting in their fight against Thanos. Following the Blip, she is present at the Avengers Compound, where she helps Smart Hulk fit Scott Lang with a new time suit and demonstrates a strong understanding of time travel technology and its rules. She actively participates in the \"time heist\" to retrieve the Infinity Stones, retracting her time suit for the mission. On Morag, she works with War Machine (Rhodey), retrieves the Power Stone orb, and reveals that others are also seeking the Stones. Her knowledge is crucial, as she shares information about the Soul Stone's location and her personal history with Thanos.\n\nA critical complication arises due to her cybernetic nature; her consciousness becomes entangled across timelines. This allows her past self to be identified by Thanos via a hologram and enables the Mad Titan to access future memories, learning the Avengers' plan. This leads to her being captured and held in a prison cell on his ship, Sanctuary II, where she has a conversation with an alternate-timeline Gamora about their potential future relationship. In the ensuing conflict, she confronts her past self (referred to as \"Bad Nebula\"), who beats her and jacks into the quantum console with her intact arm. Nebula tries to convince the alternate Gamora to stop Thanos from finding the Soul Stone and later helps protect the Gauntlet from him. During the final battle, she joins the united women of Marvel in a pivotal charge and takes out the enemy Cull Obsidian.\n\nHer heroism is also shown in more personal moments. After the battle on Titan, she is adrift in space with Tony Stark, finding him unconscious and helping him return to Earth. During their journey, she tends to his wounds and plays paper football with him to pass the time. Ultimately, she"}, {"id": "\"ROTH\"", "entity_type": "\"PERSON\"", "description": "ROTH is a brilliant physicist and a key crew member on a deep space expedition. He is a detached and analytical scientist, responsible for operating controls, analyzing complex situations, and making critical decisions regarding mission trajectory and crew safety. Roth identifies and names celestial objects such as Gargantua and Pantagruel, and he expertly explains relativistic phenomena like time dilation. He creates system models to analyze the ship's trajectory, monitors radiation levels, and identifies threats such as the approach of a black hole and a neutron star.\n\nHis inquisitive nature leads him to examine mysterious objects and alien organisms with fascination. He previously found a small black box on an ice planet, and when the crew discovers a massive, similar version on a space station, Roth analyzes the wormhole, believing it was created intentionally. He is jubilant upon discovering a gravity-adjusting prototype device, analyzes its alien technology, and becomes a strong advocate for using it to ensure human survival through dispersal, proposing it could be used to reduce Earth's gravitational field.\n\nRoth's commitment to the mission's long-term goals is absolute. He devises a plan to use a gravity black box to slingshot a lander away from a planet's surface, a maneuver that requires his sacrifice. He ultimately gives his life by taking a one-way trip on a rocket to activate the device. In a separate, contradictory account, his death is also described as being instantly crushed by a collapsing moon. Resolving this, his primary and most detailed sacrifice is the intentional, one-way mission to activate the gravity device, a act for which he is later referenced by Brand as being correct about the need to continue exploring rather than returning to Earth."}, {"id": "\"FIGHT\"", "entity_type": "\"UNKNOWN\"", "description": "\"The fight between Ronin and Yakuza members continues through the upper
